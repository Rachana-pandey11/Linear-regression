# Linear-regression

Dataset Used:

Student dataset is used in which three columns are present named as Math, Reading and Writing
which consists of the marks of 1000 students out of 100.


Algorithm:


Linear regression is one of the very basic forms of machine learning where we train a model to
predict the behaviour of your data based on some variables. In the case of linear regression as you
can see the name suggests linear that means the two variables which are on the x-axis and y-axis
should be linearly correlated.

Mathematically, we can write a linear regression equation as:

y = a + bx

Here, x and y are two variables on the regression line.


b = Slope of the line.

a = y-intercept of the line.

x = Independent variable from dataset

y = Dependent variable from dataset
